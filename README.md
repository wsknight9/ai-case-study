# TITLE “AI Benefitting Humanity”


## Overview and Origin


* Name of company – OpenAI
* When was the company incorporated? December 11, 2015
* Who are the founders of the company? The founders of Open AI are Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, Wojciech Zaremba, and Elon Musk (Introducing Openai).
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? According to the Britannica Money website, OpenAI was developed to pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI) “-an evolved (and theoretical) iteration of AI that gives machines the adaptive ability to learn, understand, and apply intelligence to tasks across multiple domains in a manner that’s similar to, or exceeds, human capacity.” (Montevirgen).
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? In the beginning of OpenAI, it was a nonprofit organization funded by the founders and other investors that allowed OpenAI to research and operate with a “$1 billion war chest” (Montevirgen).  In 2019, OpenAI transitioned into two operating models, an unconventional hybrid nonprofit and for-profit, allowing the company access to more capital and into a $1 billion commitment from Microsoft (Montevirgen). In 2023, Microsoft reportedly contributed another $10 billion to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence quest. Earlier this year *The New York Times* reported on February 16, that OpenAI was valued at $80 billion or more due to a deal that allowed the employees to cash out their shares in OpenAI (Metz et al). OpenAI is a private company who does not publicly disclose their financials or ownership stakes. OpenAI funding is comprised of individuals and institutional investors, such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Infosys and big-name venture capital funds Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, Tiger Global, Thrive, K2 Global, and Andreesen Horowitz (Bylund).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? The specific problem OpenAI is trying to solve is stated in their mission statement “to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity?”. OpenAI believes that their vision for the future ensuring that “artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI systems that are generally smarter than humans – benefits all of humanity” (About).
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? OpenAI’s intended customer is every human on Earth. As of today, June 13, 2024, the world population is 8.1 billion (Current). To scale this down to OpenAI’s demographics it is reported that they have “a user base of 180.5 million” which comprises of “56.11% male and 43.89% females” (Elad).
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) *Information Week* posted a story March 13, 2024, with the headline “Can Anyone be a Realistic Competitor for OpenAI?” (Pallardy). OpenAI has been the leader of artificial intelligence; being the front runner in artificial intelligence is their unfair advantage, plus they offer it for free.
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization who creates technology for others. The technologies OpenAI is currently using or developing is generative AI applications, AI-generated content, coding, voice and audio synthesis, cybersecurity, AI assistants, AI chatbots and personal use and entertainment (Kantor). 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? OpenAI is in the field of research for artificial intelligence.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? According to IBM they claim the major trends and innovations for the field of artificial intelligence over the last 5 to 10 years are in 2015, Baidu’s Minwa supercomputer uses a special kind of deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy that the average human, in 2016, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves?). Later, Google purchased DeepMind for a reported $400 million, and in 2023, a rise in rise in large language models, or LLMs, such as ChatGPT, create an enormous change in performance of AI and its potential to dive enterprise value. With these new generative AI practices, deep-learning models can be pre-trained on vast amounts of raw, unlabeled data”  (What).
* What are the other major companies in this field? Other major companies in artificial intelligence are Athropic, DeepMind, Cohere, Stability AI and Inflection AI (Kantor).

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? OpenAI’s impact to artificial intelligence has been “developing safe and responsible artificial intelligence, which involves designing our models with safety in mind and proactively intervening against malicious use” (Disrupting).
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? According to Acacia Advisors, the core metrics that companies in artificial intelligence use to measure success are “efficiency metrics which assesses how artificial intelligence technologies streamline operations and reduces the time and resources required to complete tasks, accuracy metrics which measures the correctness of outputs provided by artificial intelligence systems, performance metrics which encompasses a broader set of indicators that assess the overall effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications, and financial impact metrics which quantifies the economic benefits derived from artificial intelligence initiatives” (Anchia).
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? Based on the amount of research on the topic of artificial intelligence and the company OpenAI they are outperforming relative to competitors in the artificial intelligence world.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) If advising OpenAI for products or services would suggest they offer a specific product for Construction documentation tracking in an efficient manner.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? I think that if OpenAI offered a documentation tracking product for Construction would be a great benefit for the company because the Construction industry is one of the least automated industries regarding the documentation needed.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? This additional product would utilize OpenAI’s ChatGPT. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? OpenAI’s ChatGPT seems to be the fastest growing technology and it seems to be the appropriate technology for the documentation control.
